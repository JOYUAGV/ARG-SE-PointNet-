# Adaptive Radius Grouping and Squeeze-Excitation-Enhanced PointNet++ for Individual Tree Segmentation in Dormant Apple Orchards

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Adaptive Radius Grouping and Squeeze-Excitation-Enhanced PointNet++**, designed for **individual tree segmentation** in dormant apple orchards. The proposed method improves feature extraction by:
- **Adaptive Radius Grouping (ARG):** Dynamically adjusting feature aggregation radii based on tree structure.
- **Squeeze-Excitation (SE) Mechanism:** Enhancing feature representation through adaptive channel weighting.

Additionally, three datasets were constructed (real-world, simulated, and hybrid), and three training strategies were explored to analyze the impact of dataset quality, scale, and training approaches on model performance.

The best-performing model, **msarg_se trained with Strategy II (Hybrid Dataset Training)**, achieved **97.379% Accuracy** and **91.348% mIoU**, demonstrating superior segmentation performance in dormant orchard environments.

## ðŸš€ Code Release
The code and datasets will be **publicly available** upon the acceptance of our related research article. Stay tuned for updates.
